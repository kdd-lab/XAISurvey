# XAI Survey 

A Vue.js visual interface to browse the list of methods of the survey on XAI. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```


## Adding new methods to the list

The list of all methods is maintained in the file ```static/methods.json```. If you want to contribute a new method, you may extend the list of entries within the file, by the following steps:
 1. clone the repository and create a separate branch;
 2. modify the file adding your contribution
 3. run the node application to check that the interface is working properly
 4. commit the changes and send a pull request

 We will check periodically the submitted methods and, if compliant with the format of the catalog, thery will be merged in the main branch
